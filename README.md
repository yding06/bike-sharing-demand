## Introduction
Bike sharing system is a means of renting bicycles throughout a city. It enables people to rent a bike from one location and return it to a differnet place on an as-needed basis. This project is aiming at forecasting bike demand in DC area.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset covers two years' bike renting records. It totally contains 11 featrues including time, season, holiday, weather, temp etc. The target variable is the count/demand.

The training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each months.

The test set contains the data from the 20th to the end of the month.
